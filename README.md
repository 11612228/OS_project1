## Task 1: Efficient Alarm Clock

### 1.Data structures and functions

#### Modified Structs
##### `struct thread`(threads/thread.h)
- add `int64_t block_tick` to thread.
- The `thread_block` is 0 when the thread is initialized.
#### New Functions
##### `void thread_block(void)`(threads/thread.c)
- Call this method to make the current thread's `status` as `THREAD_BLOCKED` and toggle the current thread.
##### `void thread_foreach (thread_action_func *func, void *aux)`(threads/thread.c)
- The incoming `blcok_thread_check ()` passed as a parameter to `thread_foreach()`.

#####  `void blocked_thread_check (struct thread *t, void *aux UNUSED)`
- Each time this method is called, the thread's block_tick is subtracted by one.
- The `thread_unblock()` method is called to unblock if block_tick equals 0.

##### `void thread_unblock (struct thread *t)`
- `thread_unblock()` puts the thread in the ready queue to continue running:

##### `void blocked_thread_check (struct thread *t, void *aux UNUSED)`(threads/thread.c)

#### Modified Functions
##### `timer_sleep()`(devices/timer.c)
- take out busy-wait.
- The current thread's `block_tick` is assigned as `ticks`.
- Call `thread_block` method.

##### `static void timer_interrupt (struct intr_frame * args UNUSED)`(devices/timer.c)
- Add `void thread_foreach()` function inside `timer_interrupt`.



### 2.Algorithms
Turn the current thread into a `THREAD_BLOCKED` state, record the time to be blcok with block_tick, and join the thread state check by using the OS itself to perform a time break for each tick. Each time check for the thread's block_tick minus one, unblock the thread if block_tick is 0 and put it in the ready queue.

## Task 2: Priority Scheduler
### 1.Data structures and functions

#### New Structs

#### Modified Structs

#### New Functions
##### `bool thread_cmp_priority (const struct list_elem *a, const struct list_elem *b, void *aux UNUSED)`
- Compares the priority of thread a and thread b, and returns true if a>b.
##### `void list_insert_ordered (struct list *list, struct list_elem *elem,list_less_func *less, void *aux)`
- A function can insert the threads sequentially into the ready queue.
#### Modified Functions
##### `void thread_unblock (struct thread *t)`(threads/thread.c)
- Call `list_insert_ordered()` instead of `list_push_back()` to ensure that the ready queue is the priority queue.
##### `void thread_yield (void)`(threads/thread.c)
- Call `list_insert_ordered()` instead of `list_push_back()` to ensure that the ready queue is the priority queue.
##### `void thread_init(void)`(threads/thread.c)
- Call `list_insert_ordered()` instead of `list_push_back()` to ensure that the ready queue is the priority queue.
##### `void thread_set_priority (int new_priority)`(threads/thread.c)
- Call `thread_yield ()`
##### `tid_t thread_create (const char *name,int priority,thread_func *function, void *aux)`(threads/thread.c)
- After calling thread_unblock(t)ï¼Œadd the following code
```
if (thread_current ()->priority < priority)
   {
     thread_yield ();
   }
```
